<h3>What are my expectations after I finish the program?</h3>
<p>
  My expectations are that with the knowledge that I have gained
  I will have the confidence and skills to start a career.
  I am aware that at first I will start with an entry level position
  but that means that I will gain even more skills from the senior
  developers which will open more opportunities.
